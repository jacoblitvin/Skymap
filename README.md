# Skymap
A solar system mapping program.

Clone the repo, or download objects.txt along with starmap.py. Run starmap out of your favorite IDE, or out of the command line, and tell the program where you want to see the solar sytem from. It will produce an ALT-AZ map for you, tracing out the ephemerides for whatever bodies are currently above the horizon. Try it from anywhere on Earth.
